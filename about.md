# About me

I did my BSc from University of Allahabad, India in Physics and Mathematics in 2005, after which I joined the Integrated PhD (MSc+PhD) program at Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI), Allahabad, India. I finished my MSc in Physics from HRI in 2008, and continued the program to finish PhD in physics in 2013 with thesis on “The Effect of Geometric Frustration on Some Correlated Electron Systems”.

After submitting my PhD thesis, I joined Prof. Stefano Sanvito’s research group at Trinity College, Dublin in 2013, and I continue to work there.

Rajarshi am a Research Fellow at the School of Physics, Trinity College Dublin. My research interests range over computational materials science, and condensed-matter physics. I specialise in physics of strongely correlated electrons, such as Mott transition, magnetism of itinerant electrons, electron phonon interactions. My interests are geared towards solving appropriate models of many-body interaction, such as Hubbard model, Double exchange model, Holstein model, Heisenberg model through real space based techniques like Monte-Carlo methods and Exact-Diagonalization. More recently, I have been interested in
(i) exploring methods for structure property relations of materials with use of High-Throughput *ab initio* and dataminig approach,
(ii) application of artificial intelligence in solving models of many-body physics and in learning structure-propery relation of materials.
